- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @garyjkuehn
- Iâ€™m interested in finding, leveraging and improving engineering practices under the broad category of CICD.
- ðŸŒ± My language preference is python. A few repos focus on CICD tooling while others are hobby projects for topics such as:
-  weather reporting (my local area), AI model usage, Celestial object investigations.
